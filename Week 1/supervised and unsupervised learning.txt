Supervised Learning
  In supervised learning, the data given has the "answers" in the results.
  What this means is that we already know the outcomes of the data we are using.
  This way, when the model makes a prediction, it can be checked against the real world data.
  The results of the model can be supervised in the sense that we have something to compare it to.
  An example would be teaching a model to predict possibility of cancer based off a dataset that shows the size of benign and malignant tumor growth

Unsupervised Learning
  In unsupervised learning the data given has no real labels or results in it.
  Instead it's just a set of data that the model is supposed to tell us information about.
  An example would be teaching a model to determine specific groups of people based on the genetic patterns in their DNA (without any guidance).
